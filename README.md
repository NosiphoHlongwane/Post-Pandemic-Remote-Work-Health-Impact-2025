# Post-Pandemic Remote Work Health Impact Analysis (2025)

This project investigates the **impact of post-pandemic remote work on employee health and well-being**, with a focus on **burnout, work-life balance, mental health, and physical health issues**. Using **R (tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, corrplot, nnet, lubridate)**, the study applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling to uncover actionable insights for organizations.

## About the Project
The study explores how **remote and hybrid work arrangements post-pandemic affect employee well-being**.  
Key aspects include:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of survey responses  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for demographic, work, and health variables  
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships among work hours, burnout, and isolation  
- Regression models to predict burnout risk and work-life balance outcomes  

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains survey responses from employees on:  
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Region, Industry, Job Role  
- **Work patterns:** Work arrangement, Hours per week  
- **Health & Well-being:** Burnout level, Mental Health Status, Work-Life Balance Score, Social Isolation Score, Physical Health Issues

## Tools Used
- **R** (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, corrplot, nnet, lubridate) → Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- **CSV dataset** → Employee survey data on post-pandemic work habits and health  

---

## Analysis Process
The project followed a structured workflow:  
1. **Data Cleaning:** Standardized categorical variables and handled multiple health issues  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Descriptive statistics, distribution analysis, and visualizations  
3. **Correlation & Regression:** Linear regression (work-life balance), logistic regression (high burnout probability), multinomial regression (burnout levels)  
4. **Visualization:** Histograms, boxplots, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps  

---

## Key Findings
- Employees working longer weekly hours are **more likely to experience high burnout**.  
- Work-life balance **decreases with longer hours and higher social isolation**.  
- Hybrid and flexible work arrangements generally **improve well-being**.  
- Top physical health issues include **fatigue, back pain, and eye strain**.  
- Predictive models confirm that **long hours + high isolation scores increase burnout risk**.

## Visual Highlights
- **Age distribution by gender**  
- **Weekly work hours by work arrangement**  
- **Burnout levels vs weekly hours**  
- **Work-life balance by work arrangement**  
- **Top 10 physical health issues**  
- **Correlation heatmap of numeric variables**  
- **Burnout levels by work arrangement**  
- **Work-life balance vs work hours (by mental health status)**

## Conclusion
Post-pandemic remote work significantly affects employee health:  
- Excessive hours and social isolation increase burnout and reduce work-life balance.  
- Hybrid/flexible models improve employee well-being.  
- Organizations can use these insights to implement **wellness programs, flexible schedules, and ergonomic support** to enhance workforce health and productivity.
